# Introduction

The Carpenter's Mission (formerly The Carpenter's Academy) is a nonprofit organization incorporated in 2018 in the state of West Virginia. In this section, you can find out some of our history and what drives us to serve.

We have a fierce commitment to our values; and from the start, we want to reflect this in all the choices we make, from our governance structure, to our daily working practices, how we look after our people and manage employment, to financing. 

We believe that our internal practices have significant implications, not only for the success of our mission, but also for the spiritual wellbeing and salvation of those who serve with us. Too many of us have been wounded by ministry models that reflected Christ to the world, but not to their own workers. Without divine power, this is an impossible task: but we are striving to create an organization that ministers both to the communities we serve and to the individuals who are serving (1 Timothy 4:16).
