# How we work and what we value

Our mission is important, but how we carry out our mission is just as important -- perhaps **more** important. Too many Christian ministries present a loving gospel to the world while living out a starkly different Christianity in the workplace culture. This misalignment ha significant implications for the spiritual outcomes of our colleges, for the purpose of true mission work is both to save the world and to save those who serve. The same blessing and value that we want to give to the community outside has to begin with the culture of the organization on the inside.

Before we can create policies and structures that define our work and ministry, we need to determine what we care about. What drives out decision-making process? How do we look after the wellbeing of the people under our care? Why should someone choose to work at our ministry?

This is the purpose of **our core values.**



**HOPE**

**H**umans first.

**O**penness.

**P**athways and Possibilities.

**E**ternity.

## We put humans first.



## We are open.



## We believe in possibilities and create pathways.



## We keep eternity in mind.
