# Governance

As a nonprofit corporation, The Carpenter's Mission has a board of directors, which serves a similar governance function to boards of other West Virginia corporations.

> A board is:

> - a group who meet regularly to look at the performance and strategic progress of the company

- at least one independent director and other owner-operator directors (executive directors)
- a group who can separate themselves from the day-to-day operations and take a birds-eye view of the business
- a group who can debate the difficult issues and come out with a clear decision for the future of the company
- ultimately, a group who guides, and is committed to, the company.

At TCM, the board is mandated in the areas of long-term strategy, legal and regulatory compliance, risk management, and approving our overall budget.

The TCM board meets monthly via teleconferencing, and collaborates together on [Loomio] between meetings (exact software platform to be determined).

Some responsibilities of our board:

- bringing business, ministry, and other subject-area expertise to critiquing and providing accountability on the operational strategy
- ensuring good governance by making sure we've got the right people & processes to deliver our strategy
- making sure the corporation complies with the law

The board balances opportunity and risk, working on behalf of volunteers, employees, donors, and all TCM stakeholders to guide and support the management of the corporation.
