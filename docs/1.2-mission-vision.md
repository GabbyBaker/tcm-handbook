# Mission & Vision

MISSION: **We exist to restore safe places for children and young people who learn, love and live differently.**

We are committed to creating new possibilities for young people with special needs and mental health issues by providing faith-infused learning experiences so that they can experience success in this world and eternity.

We hope to do this through:

* online curriculum and learning platform
* virtual mentoring, tutoring, and mental heath services
* children's cottages for displaced youth
* micro schools
* academic enrichment program for children in foster care



**What will the world look like in 3-5 years because of our ministry?**

We want to see young people overcome past adversity and be equipped and empowered not only to lead resilient and fulfilled lives through college, career, or community, but also to build faith in Christ so that they can experience His transformative, healing love in every aspect of their lives (physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually).
