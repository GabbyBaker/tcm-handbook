# Expectations of the Board

The board is the governing body of an organization which is intended to provide a benefit to the community. Because of this community service attribute, board members are stewards of the mission of the organization on behalf of the community. The board is the ultimate authority for managing the assets and strategy of the organization.

## Time Commitment

Time is a precious commodity, and respecting each other's time is part of our commitment as an organization. We ask board members to commit an average of seven (7) hours each month to the organization, or roughly 1.75 hours per week. Each board member can know that he has fulﬁlled his responsibilities and done his share of the work when he has put in the time, not when he has tried to complete every task. **There will always be more work that can be done.** To impose healthy boundaries and prevent burnout, our measure of success is showing up, not merely task completion. Formal time limits help us accomplish that.

> "When one poor mortal will try to stand under heavy burdens as though he must carry them or everything perish, he will be crushed under them and find, after all, God did not want him to make himself the burden-bearer. But when we lay these burdens upon Jesus and then do what little we can in His strength and not feel that everything depends on us, we can keep serenity of mind, calmness of spirit, and shall be in a condition to do much more effective service. 
>
> Now, dear children, I hope you will be of good courage and not do too much. We are nothing. Jesus is everything. In ourselves we are nothing. Said Christ, “Without me ye can do nothing.” [John 15:5.] Let us then do all in the strength of Jesus."
