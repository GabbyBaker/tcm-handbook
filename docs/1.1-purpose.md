# Purpose

>  *" 'This one thing I do.' Success in any line demands a definite aim. He who would achieve true success in life must keep steadily in view the aim worthy of his endeavor"  (Education, p. 262).*

One of the hardest but more critical steps in developing this ministry has been narrowing down the purpose and direction of the ministry. There are so many awesome things that can be done could; but success <u>demands</u> a *definite* aim.

Our organization is built around the **"Purpose-Inspired Education"** framework developed by [Dr. Shira Leibowitz](https://revabilities.com/home). Her principle is that schools and organizations should be grounded in a singular purpose: one word that encapsulates how we want want employees, patrons, and students to feel when they cross paths with our organization. This single purpose inspires and influences every choice we make, from Then from there, we let that singular purpose guide everything else from budgeting to discipline to curriculum to advertising.

## We Hope Against Hope.
When working with children who have faced adversity, we want to be careful not pursue elusive goals. Not every foster child will find a forever home or experience true familial belonging in this world of sin; not every youth with special needs will overcome all deficiencies or be miraculously healed. Some restoration must wait until Christ returns and the world is made new.

While belonging and wholeness are high aspirations, we believe that there is something deeper that is required to make those dreams a reality. "Healing [wholeness] requires an underlying belief that rouses energy to act." Often, persistent trauma or perceived failure threatens to erase this essential belief. So many children have come to feel powerless in the face of the cards they have been dealt. So they give up.

We believe that it was the Carpenter's mission to loose bonds, restore agency, and build pathways for a better life (Isaiah 58). We too feel called to make straight paths for feet who have been crippled by circumstances outside their control (Hebrews 12:13). To do this, we must **Hope Against Hope** (Romans 4:17-18). We must believe in possibilities where others only see impossibilities.

### How do we define hope?
Instead of just wishing for something to happen, hope is what pushes us to make something happen. It is the combination of having dreams and also having the ability to pursue them (agency) and a plan in place to make our dreams come true (pathways). And hope is *the belief that fuels that process*. If I don't believe in my potential to meet the goals, I won't make plans towards those goals. And naturally, they won't happen.

When thinking about hope in the context of healing from the past, building a new life, and having dreams for the future, sometimes we get discouraged and doubt our agency. We may feel trapped by our familiar ways of thinking and coping, and we may start to believe that maybe we cannot achieve it after all. I mean, if we could, then why is it so challenging?

In traditional hope theory, one would say, "Believe in yourself!" The moment we lose faith in our agency, we stop trying -- we stop planning and pushing.

Placing hope theory in the light of the gospel, we discover that our self-evaluation is correct: "Without Me [Christ], you can do nothing." Many of the aspirations we have, we cannot meet in our own strength. We *do* lack agency. The pathway *is* broken and blocked up.

But even when we feel caged in and powerless, there is still hope. *In Christ.* The opening line of the Carpenter's greatest and most famous sermon says, "Blessed are the *poor* in spirit." Blessed are the ones who recognize that they have nothing, that they are lacking the tools, agency, or resources to become the person they want to be. "For *theirs* is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:3).

That is the entire gospel in a nutshell: Christ gave up everything for us so that we, through His poverty, can experience wholeness and flourishing. He came to give us the power, the agency we need to become children of God (John 1:12), to experience transformation and become all that we can be. He literally came *to give us hope.*

And it is *this* gospel -- a gospel grounded in hope and faith-infused -- that we want to live out for children facing adversity. For their sakes, we are committed to bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things (1 Corinthians 13:7). Every child's experience, no matter how tumultuous, may yield hope through the power of faith and love.
