One of the hardest but more critical steps in developing this ministry has been narrowing down the purpose and direction of the ministry. There are so many awesome things that can be done could; but success <u>demands</u> a *definite* aim.

Our organization is built around the **"Purpose-Inspired Education"** framework developed by [Dr. Shira Leibowitz](https://revabilities.com/home). Her principle is that schools and organizations should be grounded in a singular purpose: one word that encapsulates how we want want employees, patrons, and students to feel when they cross paths with our organization. This single purpose inspires and influences every choice we make, from Then from there, we let that singular purpose guide everything else from budgeting to discipline to curriculum to advertising.
